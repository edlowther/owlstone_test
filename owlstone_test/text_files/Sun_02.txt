A MAN has been left fighting for his life after he was allegedly bitten by a spider during a bare foot walking through grassland.

Writing on Facebook on Friday, Kim Needham, said her male friend was walking in Skegness when he felt a huge pain which led to his foot swelling more than five days ago.

She added that he was later taken to Boston Pilgrim hospital in a critical condition with what she claims was “blood poisoning”.

The victim, who has not been named, is said to not be in danger after the “sting” was removed from his foot, Lincolnshire Live has reported.

No official details about the incident have been released.

Ms Needham says in the Facebook post that she did not want to “scare anyone” but simply wanted to raise awareness.

She wrote: “A friend of mine has spent over five days in a critical condition at Boston Pilgrims hospital with blood poisoning caused by a bite, it is not known what bit him but as he was walking around bare foot on grass, he felt a sharp pain like he’d stood on a twig.

“Two hours later his foot had swollen massively and was in severe pain.

“They don’t know what bit him but have mentioned a spider.”
