SHE only flew out to Nashville earlier this week, but Megan McKenna is already embracing life in Tennessee.

The Towie favourite emerged yesterday in the Country music capital of the US in a pair of cowboy boots and a pretty patterned mini dress.

The star showed off her slim figure in the patterned frock which she teamed with a skinny belt and leather jacket.

She also managed to find herself a ride fit for the occasion – driving around in a tomato red Chevrolet pick-up truck.

Posting a snapshot on her Instagram, the star wrote: “Check out my new WHIP! #NashvilleStyle.”

The flash motor served a dual purpose as Megan used its wing mirror to check her reflection.

She also spent time filming a few pieces to camera and taking selfies during the day’s shoot.

Megan is spending the whole summer filming new show There’s Something About Megan in Nashville where she’ll try to break into the country music industry.

And she already seems to be having a great time, posting on Instagram: “I’ve fallen in love with this city.”
She said: “I can’t wait to spend this summer in Nashville. I have been a country music fan my whole life so to go to the place where some of my favourite country music artists have recorded really is a dream come true.”

She added: “I’m excited but definitely a bit scared as I just don’t know what to expect.

“I’ve been dreaming about this since I was a little girl so this is my one big shot.”

Meanwhile Megan recently rekindled her relationship with on-off beau Pete Wicks, 28, after they were pictured together in Las Vegas earlier this month.

Fans who spotted the couple said they appeared relaxed as they mingled with other holidaymakers.

The Sun Online revealed back in April that Megan and Pete were back together just days after filming ended on Towie.
