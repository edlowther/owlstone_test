GREGGS’ steak bakes and sausage rolls and some of the most popular snacks going, but have you ever thought about how much meat is REALLY in them?

Every branch has a poster which details nutritional information about the chain’s food, including the amount of meat in the popular items.

Sausage rolls are the thing many fans go to Greggs for, so they might be shocked to discover they only contain 18% pork.

The other Greggs icon has to be the steak bake, which contains 32% beef.

And the chicken bake is made of 17% chicken, explained The Bristol Post.

It’s worth pointing out that these kinds of snacks often have a lower meat percentage than some would presume, in part because pasty makes up a lot of them.

The percentages are based on the complete end product too, so they take into account things like toppings and glazes.

For example, Sainsbury’s Jumbo Sausage Roll contains 29% pork, while the version you can get from Tesco counters has 29%.

A Greggs spokesperson told The Sun Online: “We care passionately about making great quality, delicious tasting food that our customers can enjoy as part of a healthy, balanced diet.

“All the food we make is free from artificial colours, flavours and hydrogenated fats, and has no added trans fats.

“We want our customers to be able to make informed choices and are proud to have been one of the first major food-on-the-go brand providing full traffic light nutritional information on all products via our website.”

One guy is such a steak bake mega fan he got a TATTOO of one on his leg… and he doesn’t regret it one bit.
