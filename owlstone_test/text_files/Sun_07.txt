COULD unlucky-in-love Big Brother housemate Ellie Young have finally found romance?

New pictures have emerged from tonight’s show which will see her in a passionate clinch with new boy Sam Chaloner – but things don’t go according to plan.

In the snaps, Ellie and Sam can be seen locking lips in a steamy embrace.

It looks like it happens in the bedroom, as Ellie is in her pyjamas.

But we are told that after their cheeky snog, Sam tells her she has to keep it a secret.

And by the look on Ellie’s face, she isn’t happy about that.

Sam has previously revealed that he has a “crush” on Ellie.

They got off to a good start and were locked in conversation when he first arrived in the house on Thursday.
Ellie hasn’t had the best of luck with romance in the house so far.

There was many a night when there were tears before bedtime when it came to her crush.

One of the most brutal times was when he revealed to guest housemate Marnie Simpson that she was his “kind of woman”.

It was a case of unrequited love when she fell for booted out housemate Lotan Carter.


Poor Ellie had to get up and walk away after hearing he preferred the Geordie Shore lass.

She also kept telling him she want to marry him if they were both single when they were 30.

But the final straw came when she was drunk and kept trying to kiss the former Dreamboy's neck - which caused him to storm off.

Let's hope she has more luck this time round.
