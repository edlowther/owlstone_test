A LUCKY Brit has scooped the £87.5million EuroMillions jackpot tonight.

An unknown UK ticket-holder won with the numbers 17, 35, 39, 47, 50 — with the Lucky Star numbers 6 and 8.

Andy Carter, Senior Winners’ Advisor at The National Lottery, said: “This is the third EuroMillions jackpot prize to be won here in the UK this year – and it’s the biggest yet.

“The ticket-holder has instantly become the 7th biggest ever National Lottery winner.”

Meanwhile, six Brits are holding tickets worth just over £200,000, and 51 people have won £2,681.

“The draw also saw two UK winners of a guaranteed £1 million, so we urge everyone to check their tickets to see if they’ve joined the National Lottery millionaires club”, Mr Carter added.
“By buying a ticket for EuroMillions or any other National Lottery game, every player is helping to raise money for Good Causes.

“On average, over £30 million is raised every week for projects across the UK, both big and small, from repairing Scout huts, to making Olympic and Paralympic champions.”

The first EuroMillions draw was held on February 7th 2004, by three organisations: France’s Française des Jeux, Loterías y Apuestas del Estado in Spain and the Camelot in the UK.

The odds of winning any EuroMillions prize are 1 in 13.

This year’s first Super Draw will take place on Friday 30th September. Super Draws are special drawings when the Jackpot is set to a guaranteed amount.

This amount has historically been set at €100million, or £87.7million.
